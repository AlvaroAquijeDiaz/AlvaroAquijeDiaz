# Me
- I'm currently at the 2nd year of Biomedical engineering in Peru (born here), but I've been very interested in programming since some time ago so I decided to start a Front
End Developer career that hopefully could get me some part time jobs while still studying, and maybe get a full time job in this, I feel very passionate about what I'm doing,
and will love every piece of advice and help you guys out there can give me.
