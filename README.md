- Hi, Iâ€™m @AlvaroAquijeDiaz

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and using GraphQL with Apollo client on new projects.

# Me
- I'm currently in my 2nd year of Biomedical engineering career in Peru (born here), but I've been very interested in programming since some time ago so I decided to start a Front
End Developer career that hopefully could get me some part time jobs while still studying, and maybe get a full time job in this, I feel very passionate about what I'm doing,
and will love every piece of advice and help anyone out there can give me.

# Contact me
